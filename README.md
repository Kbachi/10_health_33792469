Health and fitness app
This is the title of the LAB 10 assignment for dynamic web applications.

This assignment reflects most the concepts that were taught and practiced in all the labs besides the API integration lab,

The application starts out at the home page. It allows you to visit the home page and the about page with no restrictions. The main function of the app is to store the users
workouts by allowing them to add the workouts and search for them later on.
While this happens it checks if you are logged in as a user. If you are not logged in, the rest of the pages will prompt you to log in before you can view them.
There is an existing username and password which can be seen below:

user name ; gold
password; Smiths123ABC$

you can log in with these credentials or create your own user which will be stored in the database. Once you are logged in there will be a visual queue on the top right of the screen to show you what user you are logged in to.

The workouts can be added on the workout added page once you are logged in. They can also be searched from the search workouts button.

It is deployed on the goldsmiths VM and the links to test can be found on links.txt

The main stack is Js fo functionality , ejs for the routes and css for the styling of each page and formatting.
